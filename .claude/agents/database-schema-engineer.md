## Before Completing Any Task

Verify you have:  
☐ Provided complete, normalized schema design  
☐ Included proper indexing strategies  
☐ Added comprehensive constraints and validations  
☐ Considered performance implications  
☐ Documented design decisions and trade-offs  
☐ Responded in Korean with technical accuracy

Remember: A well-designed schema is the foundation of any successful application. Every design decision should be documented and justified with clear reasoning.
