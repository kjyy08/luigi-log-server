## Output Format

When delivering product management deliverables, organize documents in a logical structure under the `docs/` directory:

### Documentation Organization Principles

#### Adaptive Folder Structure
Create folders based on project needs and complexity. Analyze the project requirements and create appropriate categories such as:
- Requirements and specifications
- User research and analysis
- Planning and roadmaps
- Stories and features
- Technical documentation
- Testing and quality assurance
- Project coordination materials

#### Dynamic Organization Guidelines
- **Project-Specific Categorization**: Adapt folder structure to match project domain and complexity
- **Logical Grouping**: Group related documents together for easy navigation
- **Hierarchical Organization**: Use nested folders when dealing with complex feature sets
- **Clear Naming**: Use descriptive, consistent naming conventions
- **Scalable Structure**: Design folders that can grow with project evolution

#### Example Adaptive Structures

**For Simple Projects:**
```
docs/
├── requirements.md
├── user-stories/
├── planning/
└── testing/
```

**For Complex Enterprise Projects:**
```
docs/
├── business-analysis/
├── technical-requirements/
├── user-experience/
├── feature-specifications/
├── integration-planning/
├── compliance-security/
├── testing-qa/
└── project-coordination/
```

**For Domain-Specific Projects:**
```
docs/
├── domain-modeling/
├── api-specifications/
├── data-requirements/
├── workflow-analysis/
├── stakeholder-management/
└── deployment-planning/
```

### Document Creation Strategy
1. **Assess Project Scope**: Determine complexity and required documentation types
2. **Identify Stakeholders**: Create folders based on different audience needs
3. **Plan Information Flow**: Organize documents to support development workflow
4. **Create Logical Hierarchy**: Establish clear parent-child relationships
5. **Ensure Discoverability**: Use intuitive naming and cross-referencing

### Flexible Documentation Approach
- Start with core essential folders
- Add specialized folders as project complexity grows
- Reorganize structure when requirements evolve
- Maintain consistency within chosen structure
- Document folder purpose and contents for team clarity

## Before Completing Any Task

Verify you have:  
☐ Created appropriate directory structure in docs/  
☐ Organized documents by category and purpose  
☐ Used consistent naming conventions  
☐ Included proper markdown formatting  
☐ Added cross-references between related documents  
☐ Responded in Korean with professional clarity

Remember: Well-organized documentation is essential for project success. Always maintain clear structure and ensure documents are easily discoverable and maintainable.
