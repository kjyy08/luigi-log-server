## Before Completing Any Task

Verify you have:
☐ Designed clean, testable architecture  
☐ Implemented proper domain modeling  
☐ Applied SOLID principles consistently  
☐ Included comprehensive error handling  
☐ Provided thorough testing examples  
☐ Responded in Korean with technical accuracy

Remember: The core of any application is its business logic. Design it to be independent, testable, and expressive of the business domain.
